            "My journey in web development began in 2022 when I began studying HTML, CSS and Javascript. Once I had grasped the basics, I transitioned to a React-based workflow.",
            "React appealed to me due to its highly-structured yet robust nature and the ease with which highly-responsive UIs can be generated.",
